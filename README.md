# fftw
Implementation of the fftw3 in Fortran.
I suggest to use the Intel Fortran compiler, and don't forget to install the library fftw3 from

    www.fftw.org

To use the code, just download it an run make. You may test different examples (ex1.m, ... ex5.m) editing the OPEN argument inside the code.
